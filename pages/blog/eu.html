            <h1>EU Enough Project: Empowering Communities in Ghana</h1>
            <p>In pursuit of gender equality and the eradication of violence against women and girls,
                SMAid International, in partnership with Oxfam in Ghana and Women in Law and Development
                in Africa (WiLDAF Ghana), implemented the "Enough! Empowering Women, Girls, Boys, and Men
                to Take Positive Action in Ending SGBV" project in 2022. The European Union supported this
                four-year initiative to create a secure and supportive environment where women and girls
                could assert their rights without fear of violence. Throughout the year, SMAid International
                carried out activities in the Bono region of Ghana, focusing on empowering women and challenging
                harmful social norms that contribute to gender-based violence.

                <h3>Promoting Education and Awareness through Quiz Competitions</h3>
                <p>As part of this Project, SMAid International established boys' and girls'
                    clubs in eight communities and organized a quiz competition among club members.
                    The quiz focused on assessing their understanding of sexual and human rights issues.
                    By encouraging participation and knowledge sharing, SMAid aimed to raise awareness about
                    gender-based violence and its impact on society. The winners got rewarded with valuable prizes,
                    including books worth up to Gh1000.00, further incentivizing education and learning among the youth.</p>

                <h5>Integration with GSAM Award</h5>
                <p>Beginning FY2021, we incorporated Community-led Monitoring activities into the Democracy,
                    Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) and Ghana Strengthening Accountability Mechanism (GSAM)
                    awards for implementation through September 30, 2021. The project was funded by USAID,
                    and through CARE International, we got selected to be part of the CSOs implementing the meeting.

                <h3>Empowering Women's Groups with Entrepreneurial Skills</h3>
    
                <p>One of the root causes of gender-based violence is a lack of socio-economic empowerment. SMAid
                    International recognized this issue and took proactive steps to address it. Through the EU Enough
                    Project, over 300 women were provided with training in basic entrepreneurial skills, such as soap
                    making.
                    By equipping women with practical skills,
                    sought to enhance their financial independence a
                    nd resilience, reducing their vulnerability to abuse and exploitation.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Community Monitoring for Accountability</h3>
                <p>To ensure the effectiveness of this initiative and validate the impact of the project,
                    SMAid International collaborated with Oxfam and WiLDAF Ghana's monitoring and evaluation officers.
                    They embarked on joint monitoring visits to the communities where they implemented various projects.
                    During these visits, the team engaged with community members to gather valuable insights
                    on the issues of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) and assess the project's progress.
                    This process facilitated transparency, accountability,
                    and active community involvement in addressing SGBV challenges.</p>

                <h3>Celebrating International Day for the Girl Child</h3>
                <p>SMAid International commemorated the International Day for the Girl Child in solidarity with the
                    community.
                    Collaborating with the Sunyani West and Sunyani Municipal educational directorates,
                    the organization organized celebratory events at Nsoatre and Chiraa. Students from
                    local schools showcased their talents through drama, choreography, poetry recitals,
                    and other performances, highlighting the importance of empowering girls and providing
                    them with equal opportunities.</p>

                <h5>Continued Collaboration</h5>
                <p>Monthly review meetings with CSOs and HCCC members provided us with opportunities for progress
                    discussions,
                    identification of challenges, and knowledge sharing. Quarterly follow-ups ensured that we
                    implemented
                    corrective actions as agreed upon during our dialogue meetings.

                <h3>Capacity Building for Effective Club Management</h3>
                <p>SMAid International recognized the crucial role club facilitators play in ensuring the success of their
                    school clubs.
                    To enhance the management of these clubs and strengthen their impact,
                    the organization conducted capacity-building workshops for the facilitators.
                    During these workshops, program action-points for the year were developed, and
                    connections established with various government stakeholders. This holistic approach
                    aimed to create a network of support for the clubs and foster their growth as vital
                    agents within their communities.</p>

                <h3>SGBV Survivor Training and Support</h3>
                <p>SMAid International identified survivors and offered financial help as part of the project's SGBV
                    prevention activities.
                    Many survivors received hands-on entrepreneurial training. Also, they were coached and counselled
                    periodically to help
                    them access government SGBV services.
                    This comprehensive strategy empowered survivors to heal and become financially independent.</p>

                <h3>School Club SGBV Education</h3>
                <p>The project team educated school club members on SGBV and referral channels with the help of government
                    stakeholders.
                    The project team taught club members about SGBV types and causes
                    in collaboration with club facilitators.
                    They also learned about SGBV victim assistance organizations.</p>

                <h3>Boys' Club Formation and Training</h3>
                <p>SMAid International partnered with the local educational administration and club facilitators to create
                    boys' clubs. The goal was to teach boys to challenge harmful gender conventions,
                    comprehend gender roles, promote gender equality, and stop SGBV.
                    SMAid International wants to make the next
                    generation more inclusive and empathic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Strengthening Community Men's and Women's Groups</h3>
                <p>SMAid International strengthened project communities' men's and women's organizations to combat SGBV.
                    They were taught about SGBV problems and encouraged to report incidents without sheltering abusers.
                    SMAid International promoted SGBV prevention by connecting community members
                    with government organizations, including DOVVSU (Domestic
                    Violence and Victim Support Unit), Social Welfare,
                    and the Department of Gender.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Engaging Women's Sub-Committee in Human Rights Bye Laws</h3>
                <p>SMAid International worked with Sunyani West and Municipal women's sub-committees to promote gender
                    rights and SGBV prevention. These subcommittees promoted local gender-related bylaws. These bylaws
                    sought to promote gender equality and protect women's and girls' rights. SMAid International
                    institutionalized preventive measures and fostered sustainable community transformation via these
                    collaborations.
    
                    In conclusion, the Enough Project partnership with Oxfam in Ghana and WiLDAF Ghana yielded impact in the
                    fight against gender-based violence. Through various educational, economic, and community-oriented
                    activities, SMAid empowered women and girls and challenged harmful social norms. As they continued their
                    efforts in the Bono region of Ghana, SMAid International remained steadfast in their commitment to
                    creating a safer and more inclusive society, free from violence and discrimination.</p>
